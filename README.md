### Hi there 👋

I'm Felix, an experienced freelancer specializing in Mobile and Front-end development. I hold an M.Sc. in Business Informatics (1.35 GPA). Having started to create Android apps as a school student, I look back at over 10 years of developing experience. Other than that I enjoy reading (books+coffee=️💛), concerts, cinema, and cycling. I'm forward to contributing to exciting projects!

🔭 I am always open for new challenges, so feel free to drop me a message with project offers.
